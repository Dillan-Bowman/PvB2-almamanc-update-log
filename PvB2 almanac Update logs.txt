1/16 - v1.1
* Compressed everything from what would have been 5 sprites down into 2 sprites (and a little code in the stage)
* All GUI elements but the background are now clones under these 2 sprites
* Added an exit button, which deletes all the clones and shuts down the almanac.
* Added functions to shut down the almanac and boot up the almanac.
* added 11 new entries, each (except the last one) with a custom (but not canonic) entry.
* Expanded grid from a 2x4 to a 3x5, which nearly doubles the number of entries on a page
* Added the elemen-tree icons to plants that belong in those families (no stall/wall family icon exists at the time of writing to put cashew guard/almond nut in)
* added the CYS bgm from PvZ1.


1/17 - v1.2
* Added the stats and description for the warmonger bug
* Added mobile support ig
* Made the GUI look cleaner
* Added code that locks the almanac entry if you haven't unlocked the entry yet.
* Replaced page counter with a pen text engine (now 3rd sprite)


1/18 - v1.3
* Fixed a bug where the buttons of the frosty shoot and bamboozler were swapped.
* Added a real entry for the bamboo shoot
* Added a help button that is defaultly shown up on opening the almanac.
* I'll work on splitting the almanac into tabs tomorrow and giving functionality to the other keys.


1/19 - v2.0
* Split the almanac into three tabs, as promised.
   * Plant almanac: Contains all the plants from all the worlds.
   * Bug almanac: Contains all the bugs from all the worlds.
   * Miscellaneous almanac: Contains everything else. Whenever that may be tools like the shovel, or worlds like Climate Doom, there will be information and statistics for everything. 
* Added shovel entry
* Added the red bit to the error/still locked sprite.
* Added info on what almanac you are viewing to the  bottom left.
* All the keys have functionality except the [esc] key, I might just make the exit key [x] instead


1/23 - v2.1
* Added the bamtroozler
* Cleaned up some unnecessary code and removed lines of code without "hats"


1/25 - v2.2
* I'll have to add the help page back tmr or something
* Redid how the display of the entries work, and instead of cloned sprites it's now pen.
* All entry data is now compiled into 3 different lists:
   * Almanac_Entry_Data_Black.txt (contains all the text that should be shown in black)
   * Almanac_Entry_Data_Red.txt (contains all the text that should be shown in red)
   * Almanac_Entry_Data_Name.txt (Contains all the titles to each entry)
   * There is also Almanac_Entry_Data_Name.txt but it contains no data presented on screen. Instead it maps the selected entry to the list and uses that to decide what information to show.
* Replaced the PTE I was using in the project with a more compact one that works better.
* Removed all the entry costumes in the project, since it's all stored with lists.
* CUT DOWN ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT BY NEARLY 50% (From ~650KB to ~350KB)


1/25 - v2.2.1
* Minor corrections to the entries, such as grammar mistakes and removing lines of text that should not be there.
* I want to use the PTE to write the entry in a marker font but the forum explaining how to do it is down


1/26 - v2.3
* Re-Added the "Entry not found" and the "Help" page.
* Combined both almanac info lists into one to make editing entries in the future a LOT easier. 
* Added the "Recharge" Statistic to plant entries, and it is measured in seconds.


1/26 - v2.3.1
* made cloning for all the GUI elements instantaneous.


1/29 - v2.4
* fixed several errors throughout the project that labelled the version as v2.2 instead of v2.3 (it now should label as v2.4)
* Made the almanac entries much cleaner, and separate pieces of information have separating whitespace between lines.
* Fixed a bug where the project was very laggy (I had "run without screen refresh" ticked for a custom block that had [wait until <>] blocks inside it)


1/30 - v3.0
* Combined "Almanac seeds" and "Almanac GUI" into one sprite, "Almanac"
* Should be a lot easier to export 2 sprites (including the PTE) and a single stage image into the final project.
* This almanac should be moving toward the final stages of development, where it's just me adding all the entries.


1/31 - v3.1
* Fixed a bug where buttons and hotkeys would not respond to inputs
* Added new entries:
   * Dirt Tile (Misc)
   * Enchanted Tile (Misc)
   * Cursed Tile (Misc)
   * Defensive Tile (Misc)


2/1 - v3.2
* Replaced the descriptive wording, such as "tanky" or "Insane" with actual numerical values, off of @topPVZmaster 's suggestion. (doing this makes my job in the future a lot easier)
* Eat speed is calculated by multiplying the bug's in game "Eat speed" and the damage they deal with each bite, most bugs have 0.1 eat speed and 50 eat damage, so most display it as 5 eat speed.
* Moved the update log here as scratch canâ€™t handle the size of this.

2/4 - v3.2.1

* Changed all plant damaged from 30 to 20, to match what the level template has now.
